# Go Basics Exercises

This repository contains solutions to various basic Go programming exercises. Each exercise is designed to cover fundamental concepts of Go programming language.

## Exercises

1. **Hello, World!**: Print the classic "Hello, World!" message to the console. This teaches basic program structure and printing.

2. **Greetings**: Ask the user for their name and then greet them by name. This introduces variables, user input, and string manipulation.

3. **Area of a Rectangle**: Calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width as input from the user. This covers basic arithmetic operations and user interaction.

4. **Simple Calculator**: Create a calculator program that performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two user-provided numbers. This introduces control flow with if-else statements and functions.

5. **Guessing Game**: Develop a guessing game where the user tries to guess a random number generated by the program. This incorporates loops (for or while) and conditional statements.

6. **Temperature Converter**: Build a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit based on user input. This involves working with floating-point numbers and functions.

7. **Loan Calculator**: Calculate the monthly loan payment based on principal amount, interest rate, and loan term (in months). This introduces working with formulas and calculations.

8. **Text Analyzer**: Analyze a user-provided text string by counting the number of words, characters, or specific letters. This explores string manipulation and loops.

9. **Simple Web Server**: Develop a basic web server using Go's built-in HTTP package that can serve a static HTML page when a user visits a specific URL. This introduces working with web concepts in Go.

10. **Password Checker**: Check the strength of a user-provided password based on criteria like length, presence of uppercase/lowercase letters, and numbers. This involves string analysis and conditional statements.

11. **Random Password Generator**: Generate random passwords meeting specific criteria (length, character types) set by the user. This uses string manipulation functions and random number generation.

12. **File I/O**: Read data from a text file, process it (e.g., counting lines, finding specific words), and write the results to another file. This introduces file handling concepts in Go.

## Getting Started
